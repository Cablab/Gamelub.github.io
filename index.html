                    <p>My name is Caleb! I'm located in Salt Lake City. I've been playing video games for as long as I can remember
                        - I could beat my dad in Tony LaRussa Baseball on the Sega Genesis when I was 3, so pretty much my whole
                        life.</p>
                    <p>For a while, I struggled to accept that video games could be my main hobby and a career interest, so I played 4
                        sports in high school, learned guitar, considered multiple career paths, got a Psychology A.S., and had 
                        multiple attempts to permanently quit video games after convincing myself that I could spend my time in
                        better ways.</p>
                    <p>Well, here I am, managing a Discord server that acts as an online gaming community for 30+ people and doubles 
                       as a home base for the 20+ person Destiny 2 clan that I run. I'm happily married to someone who fits in great 
                       with my (mostly gamer) friends and is part of our raid team. I'm back in school studying Computer Science at the 
                       University of Utah, and planning to break into the Game Development world when I've finished. I'm unashamed of who I 
                       am: I play games on YouTube, review games on a personal blog, and talk about any nerdy thing that I want. 
                       Life is about chasing dreams, so here I go chasing mine.</p>
