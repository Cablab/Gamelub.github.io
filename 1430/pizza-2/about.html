				<p>Sweet-za Pie ia a Salt Lake City local pizza chain that serves a special kind of pizza: dessert! Pizza and dessert both have the ability to fill you up, keep you happy, and make your day, so we figured we'd combine them for the ultimate treat! We serve Sweetzas for any size that you would need, so you and everyone else can chill out and enjoy what we've made for you.</p>

				<p>We started in 2014 and have been steadily growing our population base. People really like our ideas, it turns out. With all of this support, we're working on finding a place to open up a walk-in shop to provide our loyal customers with a sit-down experience and a cool atmosphere perfect for gatherings.</p>

				<p>Your love for our product is greatly appreciated! If you have any suggestions, idea, information for location opportunities, or just want to tell us hi, head on over to our contact page and leave us a message! If you just can't wait to get your hands on a Sweetza, no worries! We're always delivering. Head to the order page and we'll see you when you answer the door.</p>
